The resume app is a simple app that shows my portfolio. 
One is able to toggle from light to dark mode on the app.
A user is also able to click the icons which will take him/ her to the relevant social media account of the developer.
The code base is made with kotlin that makes the app functional while the user interface is made with xml. 
The design is a simple single page U/I where a user can toggle from light mode to dark mode. This is made possible
using the ?attr/ color in the xml and adjusting the color according to the respective theme. I didin't use any external library in making the app. 
If I had more time I would add a link to the projects I have done and the various certificates I have received.
